# Free Money for Everyone: The Case for People's QE by Frances Coppola

## Summary

Coppola is primarily a banking specialist but also writes prolifically on other aspects of economics. She rarely refers in her writing to MMT except in critical terms, but so far as I can tell, she  shares many of its fundamental beliefs. This book which makes a strong case for helicopter money is a case in point. 

Helicopter money has a variety of meanings, but in any full-bloodied sense goes beyond conventional QE. In conventional QE a country's central bank creates money in order to buy long and medium term government IOUs (aka bonds or debt). But real helicopter money is money created by a country's central bank for distribution to its citizens. Conventional QE is narrowly focused and, according to Coppola, has benefited the rich at the expense of the less well-off. People's QE, real helicopter money, directly benefits the majority and, says Coppola, would create wealth and has a role to play in responding to population ageing, increased automation, and climate change. 
 
 This is short book (147 pages including 11 pages of notes) but  covers a lot of ground. The first chapter describes conventional QE as practiced since the crash of 2008. The aim of those interventions was to keep post-crash economies alive, and some economic commentators, particularly from the right, expressed the fear that it would cause inflation. Those commentators have been proved wrong. But QE's successes, though real, have been limited, and its effects not wholly positive. Countries which implemented it shored up their economies, but  its use has increased the wealth of the already rich at the expense of everybody else. 
 
 The second chapter is an introduction to the nature of money and provides the framework for stating just where conventional QE has fallen short. QE creates new money to buy assets, mainly government bonds, held by the rich. The rich take the money but tend not to spend it in ways that boost the economy. Meanwhile QE pushes up the prices of the assets that they retain making the wealthy wealthier still. Furthermore the newly created bank reserves used to fund the purchases sit on bank books unused by banks under pressure to the reduce the riskiness of their holdings. 
 
 Chapter three explains why giving newly created money to everyone would have  more positive and powerful economic effects than conventional QE. If they are given money, the less well-off spend more than the rich, so a helicopter drop of new money will boost the economy. This chapter unpacks the helicopter drop metaphor, and describes realistic mechanisms by which people's QE could be implemented.
  
 Chapter four defends helicopter money against its opponents. 
 
 The conventional objection is based on the fear that helicopter money is inflationary, and risks hyperinflation. Coppola spells out several good reasons to be sceptical of these arguments. She also deals effectively with the concern that helicopter money creates an irreversible increase in the money supply, by describing several plausible mechanisms by which the increase could be reversed if necessary.
 
 ## The Carney Problem
 
 Chapter four addresses with an issue raised by Mark Carney (former governor of the BOE), and on this point I found Coppola less convincing. Carney made his point to a  [House of Lords Committee](http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/economic-affairs-committee/governor-of-the-bank-of-england-2016/oral/32343.pdf) in 2016. His remarks start:
  
> on helicopter money, I am not a believer in the concept. I could give a series of reasons, but I will stick to a purely economic one. In effect, what is being asked is that a central bank cancels the debt that is purchased from the Government in order to make this truly, if you will, helicopter money.

Carney then observes that in creating helicopter money the central bank acquires liabilities, but does not acquire interest bearing assets in return. And he argues that although creating money in this way might provide a temporary boost to the economy, it would store up problems for the future:
 
> \[in creating helicopter money] the bank puts a hole in its balance sheet and moves into negative equity. In order for that stimulus to be there in perpetuity, it has to hold negative equity for ever. In other words, the Government never have to recapitalise the central bank, \[W]e would create a fundamental problem with the outstanding reserves that we have in the banking system. We have reserves of Â£375 billion sterling in the  banking system, on which we must pay interest. That is not a problem at present because the Bank rate is so low, and it would not be a problem at the time of helicopter money because rates would be as low as they could go when you would go for that option, but it would become a problem when you started to take away the stimulus, the economy recovered and the policy actually succeeded. We would not have an asset on the other side to meet that liability, and the only way we could meet that liability would be by creating more of that liability, and so you would end up in a compounding Ponzi scheme, which  exacerbates things. There is no way of structuring around that.
 
 A Ponzi scheme  pays returns only from money given by new investors. So not only is Carney arguing that helicopter money means a central bank becomes technically insolvent through causing its liabilities to outweigh its assets, he is also saying that - like a Ponzi scheme - in order to keep meeting future obligations it has to dig itself deeper and deeper into insolvency. 
 
Let's make some distinctions before considering Coppola's response. We can distinguish four types of QE:

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| Conventional QE | The central bank creates reserves, a type of money and a liability to the bank, in order to buy medium and long term government IOUs from the private sector. |
| Direct Deficit Funding | Like conventional QE except the IOUs are bought directly from the government, not from the private sector.  |
| The Carney Scheme | Like Direct Deficit Funding, but the central bank forgives the IOUs, so the government does not have to pay back the debt. |
| Direct QE | The central bank creates reserves that directly fund transfers to recipients without money passing through the government. |

As an aside, there term 'helicopter money' is loosely defined, and all of these mechanisms have been referred to as helicopter money by someone at some time, but I think it's useful to reserve that phrase for the case where the recipients of the money are the general public, and it is given to the public not in the form of  loans, but as essentially, as a gift: free money for everyone. So, according to thus definition, distribution is the main criterion for helicopter money. Being helicopter money is a matter of who gets it, and whether its free to them, the mechanism by which it is funded is secondary. So all of the above above *could* be helicopter money apart from Conventional QE. But they would be helicopter money only if the money was given directly to the public.  
  
Carney's Ponzi objection applies to what I've called the Carney scheme and Direct QE. It *doesn't* apply to conventional QE or Direct Deficit Funding because in both of these cases the central bank exchanges newly created central bank reserves, a liability to the bank, for government debt, an interest bearing asset to the bank. Carney's problem is that for his scheme and Direct QE, the central bank creates a liability for itself, but then gets no asset in return. 
 
 Coppola makes several counters to this. I want Coppola to have the best of this argument, but I wasn't quite satisfied by what she had to say. 
 
 Her first point in response to Carney concerns whether a central bank can retain confidence.  She says: 
 
 > How likely is it that people would be so concerned about negative equity on a central bank balance sheet that they lost all confidence in its liabilities?

She thinks it unlikely. But the loss of confidence in a currency is not unprecedented. If global corporations, global financial institutions and investors, and other country's central banks and governments avoid Sterling that would cause rising prices for imports and consequent inflation. And such economic problems could eventually lead Sterling to eschewed as far as practically possible even within Britain's borders. So *pace* Coppola there seems a real risk here. 

Next Coppola argues:

> For helicopter drops to be trusted even if they caused the technical insolvency of the central bank, people would need to believe that the central bank's decision to drop helicopter money was justified by expected future returns. These future returns would be higher GDP, higher interest rates and improving living standards. The hope of future prosperity is a great motivator. 

This is pretty confusing. It's not clear what hopes and beliefs are being appealed to in this passage. What matters, she seems to be saying, is the public's belief in future returns. And she appeals to hope of future prosperity as a motivator. But a motivator of what? It's not at all obvious that hope for X motivates belief in X, in fact the opposite is true: "Hope for the best, expect the worse" is sensible advice which requires the objects of the two states to be different. I see no reason for thinking hope for higher GDP, higher interest rates, and improving living standards should lead to general belief that these things will happen.

Even if some case could be made, which she doesn't make at this point, that it would be rational for the public to have these positive beliefs, that seems to me no strong reason for expecting the public to actually have them. There will be significant political opposition to people's QE, those who have spent their lives preaching austerity - pretty much the majority of politicians and journalists - will do all they can to prevent it and if it starts, to limit it. They will be seeking directly to undermine the confidence that Coppola admits is required. And I have no faith in the British public's capacity to resist these pressures even if rationally they should - see austerity, see Brexit. 

And anyway the general public is only one constituency whose opinion affects success. The nature of Britain's economy means that confidence outside of  Britain's population is as important as the attitude of her people, and a breakdown of the former can lead by the process I previously described, to a breakdown in the latter.  
 
 Coppola then takes  Carney to task for talking about helicopter money putting a hole in the central banks balance sheet, arguing that in double entry book-keeping there are no holes. A credit necessarily creates a debit,  a liability a corresponding asset to balance it. That's true, accounting conventions mean an asset must be entered when a given liability is taken on. But the assets entered exist just to balance the books, they can have a market value of nothing. And that, it seems, would describe the case when a central bank prints money and gives it away. You're  technically insolvent if the amount of your liabilities exceeds the market value of your assets. No valueless book-entry assets will save you from that. If your liabilities are larger than the market value of your assets, it's accurate enough to call this difference a gap, and not too picturesque to call the gap, as Carney does, a hole. 
 
 Still, the meat of Carney's problem for Direct QE and the Carney Scheme is *not* the issue of technical insolvency, so this is all a bit beside the point. What he seems particularly worried about is not the face value of the reserves themselves, but the obligation to pay interest that they incur. His argument is that continually creating new liabilities to pay off obligations incurred by existing liabilities is a Ponzi scheme. And Coppola accepts this, at least in theory. She says:  
 
 > Paying interest on reserves could theoretically become a compounding Ponzi as interest rates rose
 
 But, she says,
 
 > Insolvency is a factor of the whole balance sheet, not one part of it. It is entirely possible for part of the central bank's asset base to return less than the interest the central bank pays on reserves, if other assets return more than the interest on reserves. 
 
 The claim here seems to be that so long as overall the assets you have are returning interest payments that have a greater value than the interest you owe on your liabilities, you're fine, you can cover your obligations. So it doesn't particularly matter if the assets created by accounting convention to balance your liabilities are inert, so long as you have other assets that are providing a sufficient return.
 
  But Carney could well agree with that. His worry is not that the central bank will *necessarily* be unable to meet its obligations without recourse to a Ponzi scheme, but that it might end up in that situation. A point Coppola concedes. And a Governor of the Bank of England is unlikely to take that possibility lightly. If it really is a possible consequence of helicopter money, I can understand Carney's wariness about the idea. 
  
 Coppola's final point contra-Carney is that a central bank cannot become insolvent if it is supported by the government. The thought here is that government can guarantee to cover a central bank's obligations, if that ever became necessary. 
  
  > If the government guaranteed to cover any difference between the interest payments the central bank made on reserves and the returns on its assets, helicopter money would present no risk to the central bank's solvency.

How would the government raise the funds if the guarantee had to be honoured? Either bonds or taxes, I suppose. Perhaps I've misinterpreted her, but it seems the guarantee to which she is referring is a guarantee to increase the government deficit or increase taxes if there were ever issues with the central bank paying money it owed, and that would prevent the bank falling into a Ponzi-like scheme of acquiring ever more liabilities to cover the payments on liabilities it had previously built-up. 

What is the guarantee for? Coppola doesn't spell this out, but I think the guarantee is primarily to maintain confidence in the central bank so as to avoid the loss of confidence scenarios I described earlier, and in particular where institutions and global players start to avoid Sterling, something which could lead to a spiral of further global and domestic confidence-loss.  And perhaps the risk of this occurring is mitigated somewhat by such a guarantee, but a remaining worry would surely be that if things ever go so badly wrong that the government has to borrow and tax to bale out the central bank, we'd be in a awful economic situation where increased tax and increased government debt could  make things worse. And this worry undermines some of the effectiveness of the guarantee. 

So I'm not convinced by any of Coppola's ripostes to Carney.  But here's something that I don't understand. Neither Carney nor Coppola consider the fact that interest rates on reserves are not fixed in stone, do not have follow the rates on government debt, and, indeed, until 2009  in the UK were zero (one year after the US Fed started paying this interest). Reserves are bank accounts with central bank, and like normal deposit accounts although they are liabilities to bank (the central bank in the case of reserves, normal banks in the case of normal deposit accounts), and the rate of interest they offer is under the control of the bank. So the obvious solution to the problem of paying interest on reserves, were it to arise, would be ... to stop paying it. 
  
  ## Another worry: Different types of recession
  
 Finally, I want to mention another problem for central bank funded helicopter money that Coppola doesn't consider, perhaps in a longer book would have done, and which is particularly relevant to economic problems arising from the Corona virus. These problems blew up well after the book was published, but the ideas in the book are on the face of it very relevant to them.
 
It is widely recognised that recessions are not all the same. They are categorised by their cause. Some are caused by demand shocks: for some reason people stop buying goods and services. And some by supply shocks: for some reasons goods and services are in short supply. It's been known since Keynes, but seems to have been forgotten several times,  that the solution to a demand shock is for a government to boost demand, and helicopter money is in that tradition. But a supply shock is different. The techniques that work for a demand recession will not work for a supply recession. And helicopter money is a case in point. If there's problem with supply, giving people lots of money won't fix things, there'll still be not enough stuff to buy and so inflation will be the result.

Nouriel Roubini has argued ([here](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/greater-depression-covid19-headwinds-by-nouriel-roubini-2020-04) and elsewhere) that the recessions caused by the Covid-19 will pimarily demand-led recessions. For example, the pandemic will lead to deglobalisation. And, for example, a country which is actively preventing imports will not resolve the consequent economic problems this causes by giving people more money to spend.
