# What Caused the Crash?

## Intro

I'd never been to New York, but in March 2008 I attended a tech conference there.  I had a great time, but on the TV news there was incessant talk about something called 'the sub-prime crisis'; it sounded bad, but from my narrow perspective its  immediate effect  was that the pound was at an all time high against the dollar, and New York was wonderfully affordable. We ate top-end restaurants and spent happy evenings searching for the perfect Martini. 

The tech conference was held in a hotel. I remember nothing about the conference apart from this: at the same hotel another event was being hosted, one concerning Bear Stearns, a bank I'd never heard of which, I gathered, was in some difficulty. The bar was full of worried bankers. An abiding memory is an overheard conversation:  "Oh my God!", said a man talking to his colleague,  "I'm down to my last ten million dollars!".

That a well-healed banker had only ten million dollars, and that I could afford to eat in posh New York restaurants did not seem to me to warrant much concern. And there were other reasons to be sanguine. I lived in London and had not bought any property. So I had seen  prices climb to an unreachable level; a wobbly property market gave me not anxiety, but hope.

This was self-centered, and ignored the fact that people across the US were losing their homes and security. They were the immediate victims of this crisis. More forgivably I was utterly unaware that these events were the start of a global financial meltdown. 

The securities market of the early noughties was a system which, with hindsight, appears to have been ingeniously designed to blow-up. Its input were mortgages, its intended outputs included fees and income streams. But the machinery between input and output was an explosive device, and as the system operated it grew, and as it grew its explosive potential increased.  And, here's the clever part, to release that explosive potential, the system looped back and fashioned a detonation from its own input. The operation of the machine ramped up the risk of systematic, correlated failure in the mortgage market. And eventually that's exactly what happened. The machine caused the sub-prime crisis (bang!) which detonated the crash (BANG!).

## How to make (more) money

The reason that the rich get richer is that their wealth is in the form of income generating assets. An income generating asset is anything that can be legally owned by a person or company, and which makes money. To own the thing you have to spend some money, but once you've got it, it creates cash and so increases your wealth. 

If you are a manufacturer your income generating asset might be an actual machine that creates the product that you then sell. But machines are not the only income generating assets. A less tangible income generating asset is a loan. If you make a loan you own something - an IOU - which generates income in the form of interest payments. 

Many income generating assets can be bought and sold. And IOUs are no exception. The buyer of an IOU receives the interest payments and the capital when it is repayed. In fact where there is a market for IOUs they are often packed into a bundle. Loans are typically not sold one by one. But even if loans are bundled together for sale, at the end of the process the purchaser has an asset that whose income derives from the interest on the underlying loans which make it up.

Loans, and assets based on loans, are generally called 'financial assets'. So there are two kinds of income generating asset. Machines and other tangible things, and financial assets which are essentially debts, either individual debts or bundles of them. 

Whether we're talking about tangible income generating assets or financial ones, if you want to increase your wealth as much as possible, you will want to have as many of them as you can. The more you have the more money you make. 

How do you ramp up these numbers? One way is to borrow money to buy more. In accounting terms, this is called building your balance sheet.  You take out a loan to buy an asset, and so the value of the asset is on the 'assets' side of your balance sheet. But that value is matched by a debt on the 'liabilities' side of your sheet. Each asset/liability pair adds to the height of the sheet.

This is a potential strategy whether the assets are tangible or financial. Either way, in order for the strategy to be a sensible thing to do,  the interest that you pay on the debts  that you incur must be less than the income that you receive on the assets that you buy. So if you're a manufacturer, the income from your machine must be more than the interest on the loan you took out to pay for it. And if you borrow to buy financial assets, the interest based payments you get from the assets you buy have to be more than the interest that you yourself are paying.

In the case of financial assets, how can this work - why should the interest payments vary in this way? The fundamental answer has to do with differences in risk. The more risk is attached to a loan the higher its interest rate. And long term loans are riskier than short term loans because, other things being equal, the longer you lend someone something, the more likely it is that something will go wrong and they won't be able to pay you back. Furthermore if you're lending money, the risk of inflation must also be factored in, the longer your loan is for, the higher is the chance that inflation will result in the real value of the amount returned being significantly lower than the real value of the amount originally lent. 

The difference between long term and short term interest rates means that if you're a financial institution, you can use this trick: You can borrow short, at low interest rates, and lend long, at high interest rates, and pocket the difference. 

But this trick is not risk free. It implies that you have to keep taking out new short term loans. This is called 'rolling over' the loans: you pay back one short term loan by taking out another. You might borrow several million dollars overnight, at low interest rate, to pay for some higher interest bonds which will mature in five years, say. But the next day you have to rollover the loan, you have to borrow another million dollars in order to pay back the original lender. 

When things are working smoothly getting another million isn't hard. "You" are a big financial institution with billions of dollars of financial assets. You can use these as collateral. 


## CDOs and the Crash

But the model can go horribly wrong. 

Suppose the assets you were using as collateral lose value. For example, perhaps it looks like the loans on which they are based might go bad. Without this collateral it going to be impossible to obtain new short term loans to repay your previous short term loans. You can't borrow short anymore and you end up owing loads of money that you can't pay back. 

This, essentially, is what happened during the initial part of the 2007-2008 crash, known as 'the credit crunch'. Lots of financial institutions the world over found themselves in the position of being unable to pay off their short term loans because their assets no longer seemed to have they value they were previously ascribed. 

How did this happen?

The reason this happened is that financial institutions had become addicted to a particularly brittle kind of income generating financial asset. A type of loan-based bond which, it was claimed, was  mathematically proven to be super-safe. Unfortunately it but turned out to be anything but. 

These bonds were based on mortgage loans. A mortgage loan is a simple financial asset that generates an income stream.  But if you are a company that lends mortgages, you need ready money to give to the next house buyer. Remember when you make a mortgage you create an asset for yourself, an IOU. So it would be nice if you could sell the IOU asset to another organisation, a financial institution which is happy to buy it. Then you can use the money to fund further loans. 

The legal mechanisms for turning loans into something that can be bought and sold is called securitisation, and the assets thus created are called bonds, or in the case of mortgages, they are called 'mortgage backed securities' (MBS). An MBS is basically a bundle of mortgages sold as a job lot. 

A certain form of these instruments were the basis of the crash, but a particularly elaborate form that was supposed to limit risk, but achieved exactly the reverse. 

Loans can fail, the debtor might fail to keep up with interest or repayments. So any income generating financial asset carries an inherent risk. There are two ways to reduce the risk. On the one hand you can choose only assets based on loans to the most trustworthy source. For example the US government is very, very unlikely to default. So Treasury bonds are correspondingly safe. But another way of reducing risk is collect together a load of loans into a bundle that is then sliced into a number of tranches which can be sold as separate products. 

Each tranche offers a different risk. It is understood that some loans will fail, and purchasers of the bottom tranche will be affected by the first loans which go bad. The attraction to the purchaser is that this bottom tranche will have a high rate of interest. The more loans that go bad the higher the tranches that are affected. The highest tranche is the most protected. Only if a large proportion of loans go bad  are buyers of that top tier  affected.

If we assume that the chances of given loans going bad are independent from one another, this looks like a great idea that can yield super-safe financial assets from individual loans which are considered by themselves rather risky. 

There are then several further clever moves that can be made. The bottom tranche is not made of the most risky loans per se. The reason it is the bottom tranche is that if any of the loans in the bundle go bad, it's the trance that will be first affected. But that means if you're making securities, and don't sell the bottom tranches because no-one wants to take on that risk, those tranches can be mixed with bottom tranches from other tranched securities to make a new a tranched security.  You don't have to keep those low-tier loans on your books. These securities are called 'CDOs'

And the process can be repeated ... to create a CDO squared

Another clever move. You can buy insurance for a set of loans. You pay a small regular fee which ensures that if a loan goes bad, the insurer will take the hit, and pay you the capital (+ interest not sure??) instead of the original debtor. But from the insurer's point of view they now have an income stream. It carries a certain risk, it's true, because the debt might go bad, but that's no worse than the original loan.
 
 Now those insurance policies can be securitised. 
 
 And as a financial institution, the insurer can bandle policies into a tiered security just the same way that the original loan was bundled into security, and the securities than sold on. This time as 'Synthetic' CDOs [check that]

Also othrer people can take out inserance. The same thing can be insured multiple times. 

But all of these are good ideas only on the assumption that the loans going bad are independent of one another.  And in the case of mortgages that turned out not to be the case. 

How did the clever people who designed CDO's overlook the fact that people's financial outlooks tend to be connected? The answer is that they organised the loans included in a CDO by region. Historical analysis clearly showed that although mortgage defaults occurred together within a region, there had never been a correlation between regions. Based on that analysis, those creating CDOs made sure that the loans which comprised it were from a representative range of regions. 

So the inventors of CDOs relied on there not being dependencies between regional mortgage defaults, but what they overlooked was that their invention would  bring about the very thing whose absence they relied on, it would create correlation between regions where previously there had been none, and  would thereby undermine the foundation on which their safety depended. 

It happened like this. Financial institutions became addicted to CDOs and other even more exotic products based upon them like synhtetic CDOs. They were incredibly lucrative for everyone involved: those originating the mortgages, those securitising them, those buying and holding them, and those providing the funding for them to be bought. But in order for these products to be created, the system needed mortgage loans to be made, millions of them. And weirdly enough for many in the chain, the riskier the loan the better, because the riskier the original loan, the higher the interest, and the stronger the magic of tranche based securitisiation in (supposedly) mitigating the risk. But making massive numbers of risky loans across the country was unprecedented. And in that situation the historical fact that in the past mortgage defaults weren't regionally correlated, meant nothing. 

So the securitsation mechanism, whose proper functioning depended on the statistical independence of loan failure, produced vast number of highly risky, highly correlated loans.  Securitisation, in short, had the unfortunate side effect of sawing off the branch on which it had been balanced. 

That in broad terms is what went wrong, and led to a now familiar series of financial institution failures. 

It started with a gradual slowdown in the housing market in 2006, and in 2007 falls in house prices and increasing numbers of foreclosures. At the start of 2007 a handful of companies who were in the business of originating mortgage loans went bust. Then HSBC, UBS, and Bear Stearns announced some fund closures and bailouts. But the date now conventionally treated as the start of the crash is August 9th, 2007 when BNP Paribus, a large French bank, announced that it was freezing three of its funds that were exposed to sub-prime mortgage debt. 

The BNP announcement was a public acknowledgement that mortgage loans were going bad across the western world, and that securities based on those loans were consequently losing their value. The announcement accelerated the squeeze on short term lending. Organisations which had previously been active in providing these loans, stopped lending against such securities or, indeed, against any assets that seemed at all similar. 

Then in September 2007, the British bank Northern Rock went under.  Problems in the UK housing market meant that it had lost asset value, but more seriously this was an institution that relied on borrowing short term to fund its mortage assets. It had not bought heavily into sub-prime CDOs, but nonetheless found it impossible to rollover its short term loans. 

March 2008 saw the fall of Bear Stearns, this was a bank heavily involved in mortage securitisation, and it found it simply couldn't get short term funding. It needed to borrow $14 billion a day simply to roll over its loans, but the market ran dry. It was saved by J.P. Morgan which acquired it for $2, with backing from the Fed of $30 billion. 

In September Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalised. At almost the same time, Lehman brothers collapsed. 

## CLOs and the next crash.

CDOs - Collateralised Debt Obligations - were securitised, tiered debt that was based on mortgage loans. In 2020 there is a similar financial instrument called Collaterised Loan Obligations. What's the difference? 

Like CDOs CLOs are  securitised, tiered debt. But whereas CDOs where based on mortgage loans, CLOs are based on loans made to private companies. Like CDOs the market for CLOs and the extremely lucrative process of their creation, drives the need for more private company loans. Like CDOs the safety of CLOs depends on the independence of the underlying loans, it relies on failures not being correlated, or at least on any correlation being predicable and countered by the tiering structure (for CDOs this meant that loans from the same region were not grouped together in a single tier).

But there are two worries. First, like CDOs there is pressure to create more and more private company loans, and that can push the world to a situation where the original correlation model no longer applies. Secondly, there is always a possibility of unpredictable global events occurring which cause general failure. Because they are unpredictable they are not in any correlation model. But because the are global they cause failure across the board. 

Unfortunately these problems are deeply linked. The pressure to originate more loans means that the loans being made are less and less safe, as barrels are scraped. This happened for CDOs when mortgage lending cut all ties to income, and were being routinely made without any checks on the ability of the borrower to pay, 'self certifying' mortgages became the norm. This is happening with CLOs because private equity firms and investment banks are forcing companies they acquire to take heavy loans to feed the demand CLOs and to ramp up their own profitability. This makes the company more fragile, the money it makes pays off interest in the loan rather than in R&D or retaining good staff, or really anythng that does the company long term good. And the search for more and more companies on whch to inflict this model means, invetitibly, that the quality of companies being acquired starts to fall. 

So overall companies who interest payments feed the income streams are more fragile and so when an unpredictble event occurs the effects will be deeper and more widespread. 

Now can you think if anything that's happened recently that systemically ramps up the global risk of company failure?
 
 Since putting these notes together there's been  [a debate between Nathan Tankus and Frank Partnoy](https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/worst-case-scenario-or-inconsistent) based on an Partnoy's [article in Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/coronavirus-banks-collapse/612247/). As I read it:
 
 See also https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/is-there-really-a-looming-bank-collapse
 
 - Partnoy's article takes  the line that the cause of the crash were CDOs and CLOs look like they are repeating the process
 - Tankus argues that the CLOs are not like CDOs, they are like simpler mortgage backed securities. securities  per se weren't the cause of the crash, it was the exotic instruments  such as CDOs built on top of them which really caused the problem. 
 - Wikipedia definition which is rather good supports Tankus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation

 ## Quotes
 Tankus 
 
 > The key here is to understand that the problems with CDOs were not because of losses on the underlying mortgages. They were dynamite, engineered to explode. The nitroglycerin was not the mortgages but credit default swaps, a type of unregulated insurance that let purchasers bet on whether a specific security was going to fail or not. Many of these collateralized debt obligations were filled with credit default swaps tied to the riskier and lower rated tranches of Mortgage Backed Securities which I discussed earlier, which were guaranteed to fail. In addition, financial market players would bet that the CDOs they just engineered to fail would fail. Their gain was, by definition, someone else’s loss. So they engineered a set of financial transactions which would create explosive losses throughout the financial system. Imagine if the restaurant in my metaphor had rigged an entire city to explode if the rotten food they fed customers gave customers diarrhea. 
 
 Surely it's going too far to say 'the problems with CDOs were not because of losses on the underlying mortgages'?? I think what Tankus is saying is that the mortgage losses were a tigger. As in his unpleasant metaphor,  the diarrhea is the trigger but the real explanation for the devastation is not that but the complex rigging connecting disappointing bowel movements to city-wide destruction. A more wholesome analogy might be that the sub-prime mortage crisis was a detonator for a much larger securitisation crisis. 
 
 But it still seems useful to see why the detonator went off, and why it was kind of inevitable given that vast numbers of increasily correlated sub-prime mortgages were being created to feed the securitisation beast. 
 
 And he very effectively counters the anxiety expressed by both the FT and Partnoy that banks will be badly damanged by loans going bad: 
 
 > \[in the case of defaults] it’s likely that collateralized loan obligations made up of the top portion of a portfolio of loans will do the best of any of the Bank’s corporate loans. When a bank originates and holds a loan, it immediately takes losses if the borrower defaults. In contrast, it takes very substantial levels of defaults before holders of the top portion, or “senior tranche” of a collateralized loan obligation realize any losses. For any given portfolio of loans, given the same overall default rate and the same loan modifications, senior tranche holders will experience less losses than outright holders of a portfolio of loans. This structure may encourage originating lower quality loans and investors may overpay as a result of tranches being mis-rated by credit rating agencies. However, it can’t be said that this structure, in and of itself, magnifies losses for investors in the senior tranche. In fact, it works as intended- other investors bear the bulk of the risks.
