# FantastyLand: How America Went Haywire, a 500 Year History by Kurt Anderson

This is a timely and important book. It tries to explain why America has a peculiar affinity for the irrational, and lays out in detail the irrationalities with which she has been afflicted. In the first half of the book starting at the beginning of America's story with the Puritans, Anderson takes us through the various religious and other widespread manias of the the centuries following. In the second half he traces how the fashionable leftish  irrationalism of the sixties has led to the deranged populism of Trump. 

Despite the book's undoubted scholarship and range, there are  two things it doesn't mention which I think it should have. First although the case that the US is particularly prone to self-deluding irrationality is well made, it's hardly the only part of the world which whose politics and culture have been shaped by that phenomenon. Brexit, Bolsano, Oban, Netanyahu, .... The craziness in the US is part of a global phenomenon, and it's not at all clear what the causal relations are between local US madness and the what's happening all around the world. Secondly, I think that any account of the causes of the madness of America needs to pay attention to the genocide of the native population which accompanied its creation. Systematically killing all those people  while simultaneously building a polity expressing freedom and human rights must have engendered a damaging tension in the national psyche, surely. 

And although this book's thesis is compelling, and I'm sure correct in many ways, it is a dangerous book because it supports a meme, a powerful and contagious pattern of thought, that has become widely prevalent, but which I think is pathological. It goes something like this. The world has gone crazy. We are - or in some particularly pathological cases, *I am* - the last remaining voice of cool, neutral, rational thought. Everyone else has gone bonkers. 

I see this pattern all around me. And what's more chilling, I notice the telltale signs that I too have been infected. 

It is a kind of paranoia, and although it is  irrational, like  a well-adapted virus that attacks the immune system, it disguises itself as the very thing that is meant to fight the threat it poses. It presents itself as an ally to that part of the mind which tries to cleave to reason, but it is a form of madness.
