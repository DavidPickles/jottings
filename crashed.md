# Crashed by Adam Tooze: Some Notes.


## New York 2008

I'd never been to New York, but in March 2008 I attended a tech conference there.  I had a great time, but on the TV news there was incessant talk about something called 'the sub-prime crisis'; it sounded bad, but from my narrow perspective its  immediate effect  was that the pound was at an all time high against the dollar, and New York was wonderfully affordable. We ate in posh restaurants and spent happy evenings searching for the perfect Martini. 

The tech conference was held in a hotel. I remember nothing about the conference apart from this: at the same hotel another event was being hosted, one concerning Bear Stearns, a bank I'd never heard of which, I gathered, was in some difficulty. The bar was full of worried bankers. An abiding memory is an overheard conversation:  "Oh my God!", said a man talking to his colleague,  "I'm down to my last ten million dollars!".

That a well-healed banker had only ten million dollars, and that I could afford to eat in posh New York restaurants did not seem to me to warrant much concern. And there were other reasons to be sanguine. I lived in London and had not bought any property. So I had seen  prices climb to an unreachable level; a wobbly property market gave me not anxiety, but hope.

This was self-centered, and overlooked of course that people across the US were losing their homes and security. They were the immediate victims of this crisis. More forgivably I was utterly unaware that these events were the start of a global financial meltdown. 

Adam Tooze's book 'Crashed' is about this meltdown and what happened next. He  describes the power structures that ensured that the crash hurt the poorest the most, and the most wealthy the least. And he traces the course of the crash beyond the US, describing the resultant European debt crises and other global consequences. Tooze's book starts as recent history and ends as reportage because the story that he narrates is not over. The political effects of the crash have taken time to develop and are still developing. It is not too early to say what kind of effects the creash has had, but it's not yet clear how permanent or widespread those effects will be. 

This post is not really a review of this book, though for the record the book is an astonishing piece of work, being simultaneously monumental, authoritative, and an exciting and compelling read. What I want to do here, is capture some of the key points, and try to express them in my own words. 

## In Brief 

In the years immediately before the crash of 2008 governments had allowed financial institutions an unprecedented amount of freedom, and in a competitive frenzy this was used to create a vast number of investments which were based - so it turned out - on fundamental miscalulations of risk. That, in a nutshell, was the cause of the crash.

Since 2008 there have been significant political and social changes. But even before the crash disillusionment with contemporary forms of capitalism and democracy was significant and growing. The crash deepened this, and provided further impetus for change, both from the immediate effects of the crash and because the responses of many governments were inflexible, ineffective, and in some cases driven by an ideological imperative to reduce the size of the state without regard to the harm caused to their citizens. The UK is a paradigm case of this.

The main political beneficiaries of this process have been the popularist right: Trump, Orban, Bolsanaro, and, in the UK, the Brexiteers. All appealing to popular discontent and resentment, and unfortunately all likely to exacerbate the very economic problems from which the discontent originates. 

What happens next? From the perspective of a UK seemingly hell-bent on self-harm it does not seem unreasonable to expect  a spiral of anit-elitist, anti-globalist popularism leading to increasing economic damage, inequality, disillusion, and rage.  

## What Happened? 

### Financial Assets: From IOUs to CDOs.

See [CDOs and CLOs](cdos-and-clos.md)

### The Crash

That in broad terms is what went wrong, and led to a now familiar series of financial institution failures. 

It started with a gradual slowdown in the housing market in 2006, and into 2007 falls in house prices and increasing numbers of foreclosures. At the start of 2007 a handful of companies who were in the business of originating mortgage loans went bust. Then HSBC, UBS, and Bear Stearns announced some fund closures and bailouts. But the date now conventionally treated as the start of the crash is August 9th, 2007 when BNP Paribus, a large French bank, announced that it was freezing three of its funds that were exposed to sub-prime mortgage debt. 

The BNP announcement was a public acknowledgement that mortgage loans were going bad across the western world, and that securities based on those loans were consequently losing their value. The announcement accelerated the squeeze on short term lending. Organisations which had previously been active in providing these loans, stopped lending against such securities or, indeed, against any assets that seemed at all similar. 

Then in September 2007, the British bank Northern Rock went under.  Problems in the UK housing market meant that it had lost asset value, but more seriously this was an institution that relied on borrowing short term to fund its mortage assets. It had not bought heavily into sub-prime CDOs, but nonetheless found it impossible to rollover its short term loans. 

March 2008 saw the fall of Bear Stearns and the conversation overheard in the New York hotel. Bear Stearns was heavily involved in mortage securitisation, and it found it simply couldn't get short term funding. It needed to borrow $14 billion a day simply to roll over its loans, but the market ran dry. It was saved by J.P. Morgan which acquired it for $2, with backing from the Fed of $30 billion. 

In September Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalised. 

At almost the same time, Lehman brothers collapsed.

### Europe

The European crisis in  was due to a peculiar European political configuration which had created overarching monetary structures - the Euro and the ECB - but left real power in the hands of one country, and those in control had a deep but dangerously migsguided commitment to with controlling governement taxation and spending

Post unification: Hartz IV: cuts to government spending: reduced welfare, reductions in wages. Seen by 'the right' as a success. but was put in place by SPD which caused fracture of the left, and so the right gets into power. 

That's where Merkel comes from. 




## Taxation and Spending. 


A government deficit means that over a period of time, the government spends more money than it receives in income. 

THere is a popular but very weak argument for why this is bad, based on the household model. You have the luxery of having an income that is independent of your spending. If you spend less, your income stays the same so you get to save the remainder. But for a state, if you reduce the amount you spend you thereby reduce income. 

The need for counter-cyclical spending. 

The multiplier. From Tooze "In the summer of 2012 [the IMF's] staff revisted the forecasts they had made in the spring of 2010 as the eurozone crisis begain and discovered that they had systematically underestimated the impact of budget cuts. Whereas they had started the crisis believing that the multiplier was on average around 0.5, they now concluded that from 2010 forward it had been in excess of 1. This meant that cutting the government spending by 1 euro, as the austerity programs demanded, would reduce economic activity by more than one euro. So the share of the state in econmoic activity actually increased rather than decreased" (p 430) Reference to D Leigh and O.J. Blanchard "Growth Forecast Errors and Fiscal Multipliers" (IMF Working Paper 13/1 Washington DC 2013)

R & R debunked


A state which has its own currency is able to create new money. 


## Globalisation

For both production and sales, companies have to operate at a global scale, and that means that national governments too have to operate globbally, often pooling their sovereignty to increase their aggregate power and influence. Only thus can governments ensure benefit from the wealth that global corporations produce, and restrain their excesses and externalities. 

So both companies and governments think and operate globally. But not many people see the scope of their lives in gobal, internationalist terms. Many people seem comfortable identifying themseleves with the abstraction that is a nation, and many with groups that are defined by a historical narrative of oppression. But in reality our lives are shaped by our relations as employees, customers and clients of organisations that - like large coprorations and natonal governments -  have to operate  at a global scale, or, if not, are operating in a space defined and circumscribed by global realities.

This tension between local identities and global realities is bound to be uncomfortable, producing some degree of frustration and alientation. The tension is not unmanageable if the benefits of the global realities are widely enough spread and seen to be so. For example before the crash there was discontent with the way corporations moved producton around the world to wherever salaries were low, and the requirements for safety and worker security undemanding. But in rich western countries, for every community decimated by the flight of capital investment to more profitable regions, there are examples of places within the same country thriving on service based industries like finance, IT, and tourishm. So not everywhere suffered equally, and many places benefited. 

Before the crash there was resentent too of the class of highly educated, well-remenumrated people at ease working internationally, in-demand in both the public and private sectors, not just benefiting from the new order, but seemingly running the show. But although such people might seem remote and self-interested, if the wealth gap between these people and others is not too enormous, if their work can be seen to bring general benefits, if membership of the class is not closed to newcomers, and if their skills and achievements are comprehensible and appreciated, their existence as a class is likely to create no more than grumbling and low-level resentment.  


## The System

Krugman:

"What do the pre- and postcrisis consensuses have in common? Both were economically destructive: Deregulation helped make the crisis possible, and the premature turn to fiscal austerity has done more than anything else to hobble recovery. Both consensuses, however, corresponded to the interests and prejudices of an economic elite whose political influence had surged along with its wealth." NYT December 2013


In the US radical response to the crisis came from the Tea Party for example their shutdown of the US budget. This gave the middle ground to the democrats. Unfortunately it also meant that the democrats became the part of continuity and the republicans the party of radical change. Hence Trump.
