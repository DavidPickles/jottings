# Crashed by Adam Tooze: Some Notes.


## New York 2008

I'd never been to New York, but in March 2008 I attended a tech conference there.  I had a great time, but on the TV news there was incessant talk about something called 'the sub-prime crisis'; it sounded bad, but from my narrow perspective its  immediate effect  was that the pound was at an all time high against the dollar, and New York was wonderfully affordable. We ate in posh restaurants and spent happy evenings searching for the perfect Martini. 

The tech conference was held in a hotel. I remember nothing about the conference apart from this: at the same hotel another event was being hosted, one concerning Bear Stearns a bank I'd never heard of which, I gathered, was in serious difficulty. The bar was full of worried bankers. An abiding memory is an overheard conversation:  "Oh my God!", said a man talking to his colleague,  "I'm down to my last ten million dollars!".

That a well-healed banker had only ten million dollars, and that I could afford to eat in posh New York restaurants did not seem to me to warrant much concern. And there were other reasons to be sanguine. I lived in London and had not bought any property. So I had seen  prices climb to an unreachable level; a wobbly property market gave me not anxiety, but hope.

This was self-centered, and overlooked of course that people across the US were losing their homes and security. They were the immediate victims of this crisis. Perhaps more forgivably I was utterly unaware that these events were the start of a global financial meltdown. 

Adam Tooze's book 'Crashed' is about this meltdown and what happened next. He  describes the power structures that ensured that the crash hurt the poorest the most, and the most wealthy the least. And he traces the course of the crash beyond the US, describing the resultant European debt crises and other global consequences. Tooze's book starts as recent history and ends as reportage because the story that he narrates is not over. The political effects of the crash have taken time to develop and are still developing. It is not too early to say what kind of effects the creash has had, but it's not yet clear how permanent or widespread those effects will be. 

This post is not really a review of this book, though for the record the book is an astonishing piece of work, being monumental, authoritative, and an exciting and compelling read all at the same time. What I want to do here, is capture some of the key points, an try to express them in my own words. 

## In Brief 

In the years immediately before the crash of 2008 governments had allowed financial institutions an unprecedented amount of freedom, and in a competitive frenzy this was used to create a vast number of investments which were based - so it turned out - on fundamental miscalulations of risk. That, in a nutshell, was the cause of the crash.

Since 2008 there have been significant political and social changes. But even before the crash disillusionment with contemporary forms of capitalism and democracy was significant and growing. The crash deepened this, and provided further impetus for change, both from the immediate effects of the crash and because the responses of many governments were inflexible, ineffective, and in some cases driven by an ideological imperative to reduce the size of the state without regard to the harm caused to their citizens. The UK is a paradigm case of this.

The main political beneficiaries of this process have been the popularist right: Trump, Orban, Bolsanaro, and, in the UK, the Brexiteers. All appealing to popular discontent and resentment, and unfortunately all likely to exacerbate the economic problems which are are driving that discontent.

What happens next? From the perspective of a UK seemingly hell-bent on self-harm it does not seem unreasonable to expect  a spiral of anit-elitist, anti-globalist popularism leading to increasing economic damage, inequality, disillusion, and rage.  

## What Happened? 

### Financial Assets: From IOUs to CDOs.

The reason that the rich get richer is that their wealth is in the form of income generating assets. An income generating asset is a thing that can be legally owned by an person or company, and which makes money. To own the thing you have to spend some money, but once you've got it, it creates cash and so increases your wealth. 

If you are a manufacturer your income generating asset might be an actual machine that creates the product that you then sell. But machines are not the only income generating assets. A less tangible income generating asset is a loan. If you make a loan you own something - an IOU - which generates income in the form of interest payments. 

 IOUs can be bought and sold. A seller of an IOU might have originally made the loan, but trades it for a price to the buyer who then gets the interest payments and the capital when it is repayed. In some cases this involves packaging the IOU into bundle with other IOUs. Loans are not always sold one by one. But even if loans are bundled together for sale, at the end of the process the purchaser has an asset that whose income derives from the interest on the underlying loans which make it up. 

Loans, and assets based on loans, are generally called 'financial assets'. So there are two kinds of income generating asset. Machines and other tangible things, and financial assets which are essentially debts, either individual debts or bundles of them. 

Whether we're talking about income generating assets that are physical or financial, if you want to increase your wealth as much as possible, you will want to have as many of them as possible. The more you have the more money you make. 

How do you ramp up these numbers? One way is to borrow money to buy more. In accounting terms, this is called building your balance sheet.  You take out a loan to buy an asset, and so the value of the asset is on the 'assets' side of your balance sheet. But that value is matched by a debt on the 'liabilities' side of your sheet. Each asset/liability pair adds to the size of the sheet.

Regardless of whether the assets you buy are  machines or financial assets, in order for this to be a sensible thing to do,  the interest that you pay on the debts  that you incur must be less than the income that you receive on the assets that you buy. So if you're a manufacturer, the income from your machine must be more than the interest on the loan you took out to pay for it. And if you borrow to buy financial assets, the interest based payments you get from the assets you buy have to be more than the interest that you yourself are paying.

In the case of financial assets, how can this work - why should the interest payments vary in this way? The fundamental answer has to do with differences in risk. The more risk is attached to a loan the higher interest rate. And long term loans are riskier than short term loans because, other things being equal, the longer you lend someone something, the more likely it is that something will go wrong and they won't be able to pay you back. And if you're lending them money, the risk of inflation must also be factored in, the longer your loan is for, the higher is the chance that inflation will result in the real value of the amount returned being significantly lower than the real value of the amount originally lent. 

The difference between long term and short term interest rates means that if you're a financial institution, you can use this trick: You can borrow short, at low interest rates, and lend long, at high interest rates, and pocket the difference. 

But this trick is not risk free. It implies that you have to keep taking out new short term loans. This is what it means to 'rollover' a short term loan, you pay back one short term loan by taking out another. You might borrow several million dollars overnight, at low interest rate, to pay for some higher interest bonds which will mature in five years, say. But the next day you have to rollover the loan, you have to borrow another million dollars in order to pay back the original lender. 

When things are working smoothly getting another million isn't hard. You are a big financial institution with billions of dollars of financial assets. You can use these as collateral. 

But the model can go horribly wrong. 

Suppose the assets you were using as collateral lose value. For example, perhaps it looks like the loans on which they are based might go bad. Without this collateral it going to be impossible to obtain new short term loans to repay your previous short term loans. You can't borrow short anymore and you end up owing loads of money that you can't pay back. 

This, essentially, is what happened during the initial part of the crash, known as 'the credit crunch'. Lots of financial institutions the world over found themselves in the position of being unable to pay off their short term loans because their assets no longer seemed to have they value they were previously ascribed. 

## How did that happen? 

The reason this happened is that financial institutions had become addicted to a particularly brittle kind of income generating financial asset. A type of loan-based bond which, it was claimed, was  mathematically proven to be super-safe. Unfortunately it but turned out to be anything but. 

These bonds were based on mortgage loans. A mortgage loan is a simple financial asset that generates an income stream.  But if you are a company that lends mortgages, you need ready money to give to the next house buyer. Remember when you make a mortgage you create an asset for yourself, an IOU. So it would be nice if you could sell the asset to another organisation, a financial institution which is happy to own it. Then use the money to fund further loans. 

The legal mechanisms for turning loans into something that can be bought and sold is called securitisation, and the assets thus created are called bonds, or in the case of mortgages, they are called 'mortgage backed securities' (MBS). An MBS is basically a bundle of mortgages sold as a job lot. 

A certain form of these instruments were the basis of the crash, but a particularly elaborate form that was supposed to limit risk, but achieved exactly the reverse. 

Loans can fail, the debtor might fail to keep up with interest or repayments. So any income generating financial asset carries an inherent risk. There are two ways to reduce the risk. On the one hand you can choose only assets based on loans to the most trustworthy source. For example the US government is very very unlikely to default. So Treasury bonds are correspondingly safe. But another way of reducing risk is collect together a load of loans into a bundle that is then sliced into a number of tiers which can be sold separately. These are called CDOs (Collateralised Debt Obligations). Each tier offers a different risk. It is understood that some loans will fail, and purchasers of the bottom tier will be affected by the first loans which go bad, whichever they are. The attraction to the purchaser is that this bottom tier will have a high rate of interest. The more loans that go bad the higher the tiers that are affected. The highest tier is the most protected. Only if a large proportion of loans go bad  are buyers of that top tier affected.

If we assume that the chances of given loans going bad are independent from one another, this is a great idea and can yield super-safe financial assets from individual loans which are considered by themselves rather risky. 

But it is a great idea only on the assumption that the loans going bad are independent of one another.  And in the case of mortgages that turned out not to be the case. 

How did the clever people who designed CDO's overlook the fact that people's financial outlooks tend to be connected? The answer is that they organised the loans included in a CDO by region. Historical analysis clearly showed that although mortgage defaults occurred together within a region, there had never been a correlation between regions. Based on that analysis, those creating CDOs made sure that the loans which comprised it were from a representative range of regions. 

So the inventors of CDOs relied on there not being dependencies between regional mortgage defaults, but what they overlooked was that their invention would  bring about the very thing whose absence they relied on, it would create correlation between regions where previously there had been none, and  would thereby undermine the foundation on which their safety depended. 

It happened like this. Financial institutions became addicted to CDOs and other even more exotic products based upon them. They were incredibly lucrative for everyone involved: those originating the mortgages, those securitising them, those buying and holding them, and those providing the funding for them to be bought. But in order for these products to be created, the system needed mortgage loans to be made, millions of them. And weirdly enough for many in the chain, the riskier the loan the better, because the riskier the original loan, the higher the interest, and the stronger the magic of tranche based securitisiation in (supposedly) mitigating the risk. But making massive numbers of risky loans across the country was unprecedented. And in that situation the historical fact that in the past mortgage defaults weren't regionally correlated, meant nothing. 

So the CDO mechanism, whose proper functioning depended on the statistical independence of loan failure, produced vast number of highly risky, highly correlated loans.  CDO securitisation, in short, had the unfortunate side effect of sawing off the branch on which it had been balanced. 

### The Crash

That in broad terms is what went wrong, and led to a now familiar series of financial institution failures. 

It started with a gradual slowdown in the housing market in 2006, and into 2007 falls in house prices and increasing numbers of foreclosures. At the start of 2007 a handful of companies who were in the business of originating mortgage loans went bust. Then HSBC, UBS, and Bear Stearns announced some fund closures and bailouts. But the date now conventionally treated as the start of the crash is August 9th, 2007 when BNP Paribus, a large French bank, announced that it was freezing three of its funds that were exposed to sub-prime mortgage debt. 

The BNP announcement was a public acknowledgement that mortgage loans were going bad across the western world, and that securities based on those loans were consequently losing their value. The announcement accelerated the squeeze on short term lending. Organisations which had previously been active in providing these loans, stopped lending against such securities or, indeed, against any assets that seemed at all similar. 

Then in September 2007, the British bank Northern Rock went under.  Problems in the UK housing market meant that it had lost asset value, but more seriously this was an institution that relied on borrowing short term to fund its mortage assets. It had not bought heavily into sub-prime CDOs, but nonetheless found it impossible to rollover its short term loans. 

March 2008 saw the fall of Bear Stearns and the conversation overheard in the New York hotel. Bear Stearns was heavily involved in mortage securitisation, and it found it simply couldn't get short term funding. It needed to borrow $14 billion a day simply to roll over its loans, but the market ran dry. It was saved by J.P. Morgan which acquired it for $2, with backing from the Fed of $30 billion. 

In September Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalised. 

At almost the same time, Lehman brothers collapsed.

### Europe

The European crisis in  was due to a peculiar European political configuration which had created overarching monetary structures - the Euro and the ECB - but left real power in the hands of one country, and those in control had a deep but dangerously migsguided commitment to with controlling governement taxation and spending

Post unification: Hartz IV: cuts to government spending: reduced welfare, reductions in wages. Seen by 'the right' as a success. but was put in place by SPD which caused fracture of the left, and so the right gets into power. 

That's where Merkel comes from. 




## Taxation and Spending. 


A government deficit means that over a period of time, the government spends more money than it receives in income. 

THere is a popular but very weak argument for why this is bad, based on the household model. You have the luxery of having an income that is independent of your spending. If you spend less, your income stays the same so you get to save the remainder. But for a state, if you reduce the amount you spend you thereby reduce income. 

The need for counter-cyclical spending. 

The multiplier. From Tooze "In the summer of 2012 [the IMF's] staff revisted the forecasts they had made in the spring of 2010 as the eurozone crisis begain and discovered that they had systematically underestimated the impact of budget cuts. Whereas they had started the crisis believing that the multiplier was on average around 0.5, they now concluded that from 2010 forward it had been in excess of 1. This meant that cutting the government spending by 1 euro, as the austerity programs demanded, would reduce economic activity by more than one euro. So the share of the state in econmoic activity actually increased rather than decreased" (p 430) Reference to D Leigh and O.J. Blanchard "Growth Forecast Errors and Fiscal Multipliers" (IMF Working Paper 13/1 Washington DC 2013)

R & R debunked


A state which has its own currency is able to create new money. 


## Globalisation

For both production and sales, companies have to operate at a global scale, and that means that national governments too have to operate globbally, often pooling their sovereignty to increase their aggregate power and influence. Only thus can governments ensure benefit from the wealth that global corporations produce, and restrain their excesses and externalities. 

So both companies and governments think and operate globally. But not many people see the scope of their lives in gobal, internationalist terms. Many people seem comfortable identifying themseleves with the abstraction that is a nation, and many with groups that are defined by a historical narrative of oppression. But in reality our lives are shaped by our relations as employees, customers and clients of organisations that - like large coprorations and natonal governments -  have to operate  at a global scale, or, if not, are operating in a space defined and circumscribed by global realities.

This tension between local identities and global realities is bound to be uncomfortable, producing some degree of frustration and alientation. The tension is not unmanageable if the benefits of the global realities are widely enough spread and seen to be so. For example before the crash there was discontent with the way corporations moved producton around the world to wherever salaries were low, and the requirements for safety and worker security undemanding. But in rich western countries, for every community decimated by the flight of capital investment to more profitable regions, there are examples of places within the same country thriving on service based industries like finance, IT, and tourishm. So not everywhere suffered equally, and many places benefited. 

Before the crash there was resentent too of the class of highly educated, well-remenumrated people at ease working internationally, in-demand in both the public and private sectors, not just benefiting from the new order, but seemingly running the show. But although such people might seem remote and self-interested, if the wealth gap between these people and others is not too enormous, if their work can be seen to bring general benefits, if membership of the class is not closed to newcomers, and if their skills and achievements are comprehensible and appreciated, their existence as a class is likely to create no more than grumbling and low-level resentment.  


## The System

Krugman:

"What do the pre- and postcrisis consensuses have in common? Both were economically destructive: Deregulation helped make the crisis possible, and the premature turn to fiscal austerity has done more than anything else to hobble recovery. Both consensuses, however, corresponded to the interests and prejudices of an economic elite whose political influence had surged along with its wealth." NYT December 2013


In the US radical response to the crisis came from the Tea Party for example their shutdown of the US budget. This gave the middle ground to the democrats. Unfortunately it also meant that the democrats became the part of continuity and the republicans the party of radical change. Hence Trump.
