## Books
### It's Not About the Burqa: Muslim Women on Faith, Feminism, Sexuality and Race by Mariam Khan
rating: 8
- Essays by Muslim women about being Muslim in the U.K. today. 
- Every essay was illuminating in its own way, from a diverse range of perspectives. 
### East West Street: on the origins of genocide and crimes against humanity by Philippe Sands
rating: 8
- A personal investigation of Sands' Jewish roots in eastern Europe evolves into a broader history of the development of international law and the people involved in shaping the legal concepts used in the Nurembgerg trials. 
- Complex stories and legal debates deftly woven together into a coherent whole. 
- Not always easy to follow, you need a pretty good idea of the history of the period.
### Helgoland by Carlo Rovelli
rating: 7 warning
- History of quantum mechanics, a new interpreation, and the mind/brain problem solved: all in 200 pages. 
- Wildly overambitious but elegantly written.
- The explanations were well written but maybe not as clear as they could have been, for some people that made the book infuriating. 
### Men Who Hate Women: From incels to pickup artists, the truth about extreme misogyny and how it affects us all by Laura Bates
rating: 8
- Well researched and convincing case that there's a growing problem.
- Introductory chapter seemed hasitly written, but the rest of the book a good though depressing read. 
### The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and How to Build a Better Economy by Stephenie Kelton
rating: 9
- Clear and convincing argument for Modern Monetary Theory
- A great book for explaining the main ideas of MMT and why they are of vital importance.
### The Tyranny of Merit: Why the Promise of Moving Up Is Pulling America Apart by Michael Sandel
rating: 7
- Good read, arguably an important diagnosis of the current US malaise.
- Caused debate, a lot around how to interpret the main arguments.
### The Triumph of Doubt: Dark Money and the Science of Deception by David Michaels
rating: 5
- Glad this book exists, it makes a solid case that there are serious problems with regulation in the US and globally.
- A bit dull.
### War of Return, The: How Western Indulgence of the Palestinian Dream Has Obstructed the Path to Peace by Adi Schwartz and Einat Wilf
rating: 6
- Cogent argument.
- Well written.
- One sided, and I got the feeling one author was less inclined to give any sympathy or voice to the Palestinian side.
### The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity by Toby Ord
rating: 6
- Deep well written sustained analysis, but my interest was limited because of restriction to only existential threats which seems to omit the ones that should be most pressing.
### The Future We Choose: A Stubborn Optimistâ€™s Guide to the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivet Carnac
rating: 6
- Intended to be positive and inspiring about what you can do about climate change.
- Instead illuminating but a bit depressing.
### The Biography of Loneliness: The History of an Emotion by Fay Bound Alberti
rating: 5
- Good topic but tenatively argued. I found it hard to pin down what she was saying.
### The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity by Douglas Murray
rating: 2
- Expecting controversial, got annoying and half-baked.
###  Domininion by Tom Holland
rating: 8 warning
- One of the most controversial books in terms of interest and enjoyment.
- I liked it a lot. Punchy, well written, a strong though very debatable central thesis, well organised and an incredible range of reference.
- Others found it wrong-headed, annoying, bordering on offensive.
###  What is Populism by Jan Werner Muller
rating: 8 warning
- I thought it was clear and well argued, nicely explaining a complex thesis and a lot of ancillary ideas about democracy. 
- Others didn't like it so much, I think they felt it missed the point somehow.
###  Man's Search for Meaning by Victor E Frankl
rating: 5
- Harrowing and insightful account of experience camps.
- But a patchy as an explanation or intellectual foundation of existential psychotherapy.
###  Inventing ourselves: The Secret Life of the Teenage Brain.  by Sarah-Jayne Blakemore
rating: 5
- I didn't really get this book - I'm afraid not much has stayed with me...
###  Superior: The return of race science by Angela Saini
rating: 6
- Good read, well written
- Unfortunately the only bit I can remember is the argument from a prominent geneticist that perhaps there is something in race after all: some ways of thinking about it have been thoroughly debunked, but not all.
- Also I think she missed the argument that IQ tests really don't measure anything of objective scienctific value.
### Love's Executioner and other tales of Psychotherapy by Irwin Yalom
rating: 8
- Beautifully written and engaging
- Everyone in book club liked it.
### Other Minds: The Octopus, The Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness by Peter Godfrey Smith
rating: 8
- Beautifully written, engaging and intelligent book.
- Well liked in book club.
- Doesn't go as deeply into the philosophical issues as the title suggests it might, but a good read.
###  Bullshit Jobs: The Rise of Pointless Work, and What We Can Do About It by David Graeber
rating: 8 warning
- Fun read bursting with subsersive ideas
- Made sense of much of my frustration with corporate life.
- Some in the group thought it had big intellectual gaps, e.g. is it really waste when it is essential to try several ideas, many of which you know won't work?
### Various Trans Readings
###  The New Working Class: How to Win Hearts, Minds and Votes by Claire Ainsley
rating: 5
- Well intentioned, well researched policy recommendations
- Earnest and a bit dull
### The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It's Broken by The Secret Barrister
rating: 7
- Eye opening descriptions of the shitshow that is the criminal law in the UK.
###  Why I'm Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge
rating: 6
- Descriptions of the problems of being black in the UK
- Well written and angry.
- Felt like I wasn't the audience she was addressing, and if she doesn't want to talk to me, why should I care?
###  Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by JD Vance
rating: 8 warning
- Life and culture in poor white America by someone who worked his way out.
- I liked it very mcuh - vividly written, authentic; seemed to me an insight into a way of life I knew little about.
- Very divisive book - others in book club thought it sexist and dishonest.
###  Basic Income: And How we can make it happen. by Guy Standing
rating: 6
- Some well-researched, realistic policy ideas for basic income.
- Missed the MMT option, everything dependend on tax, maybe that's politically necessary but meant a big intellectual gap.
- Rather a dry read.
###  Out of the Wreckage: A new politics for an Age of Crisis by George Mombiot
rating: 6
- I enjoyed it at the time, and it seemed important. But apart from that I can remember nothing about it at all, sadly. And things seems to have become significantly worse since it was written.

rating: 8

rating: 9
- Important and convincing account of different moral frameworks that people bring to their lives. And why we should respect those differences.
### Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow by Yuval Noah Hrari
rating: 5
- Not quite as big and important as it thinks.
- The most interesting ideas are, I think, from his previous book 'Sapiens'. Which one day I'll read.
###  Social Class in the 21st Century by Mike Savage
rating: 2 warning
- Based on the BBC's Great British Class Survey
- A summary of their satistical clustering analysis.
- Unpolished, uninsightful and for me very boring.
- I was disappointed, but perhaps I was looking for more than was ever intended.
###  Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences by Cordelia Fine
rating: 8 warning
- I had to miss this book club meeting and didn't finish the book.
- But it was extremely popular, so that why I've given it high rating with a warning.

- Mixed reception in the group, some thought it lacked any economic sophistication.
### Debt: The First 5000 Years by David Graeber
rating: 9 warning
