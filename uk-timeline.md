## Background

Trump weakens and defunds CDC which in the past had co-ordinated global responses to pandemics (sources?)

From https://bylinetimes.com/2020/04/11/a-national-scandal-a-timeline-of-the-uk-governments-woeful-response-to-the-coronavirus-crisis/

> October 2016: Exercise Cygnus, a three-day training exercise on how to deal with a pandemic, is carried out, involving all major Government departments, the NHS and local authorities. “It showed gaping holes in Britain’s Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response plan.” A report on the exercise has never been published, with a senior former Government source with direct involvement saying that the findings were deemed “too terrifying” to be revealed. A senior academic directly involved in Exercise Cygnus and the current pandemic said: “These exercises are supposed to prepare government for something like this – but it appears they were aware of the problem but didn’t do much about it.” (Sunday Telegraph) 

> 14 September 2017: A National Risk Register Of Civil Emergencies is published by the Cabinet Office. The report notes that “there is a high probability of a flu pandemic occurring” with “up to 50% of the UK population experiencing symptoms, potentially leading to between 20,000 and 750,000 fatalities and high levels of absence from work”. (Cabinet Office)

> 30 July 2018: A UK biological security strategy is published, addressing the threat of pandemics. It “was not properly implemented, according to a former Government chief scientific advisor… Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, said a lack of resources was to blame”. (Guardian)

From https://t.co/fw46OLPTwg?amp=1

> In England, 17,000 people a year are estimated to die annually from flu, but this varies notably according to levels of pre-existing immunity to the prevalent strain, the take-up of the available vaccine and how well it has anticipated that year’s strains of flu. Thus, in 2014–15 some 28,330 people died, while in 2018–19 the number was down to 1,692.

> One pandemic regularly recalled from the pre-vaccination age is the ‘Spanish’ flu that lasted from 1918–20, infecting up to a billion people worldwide and killing between 50 and 100 million.9 More recently, the ‘Asian’ flu of 1957–58, which began in southern China, and the Hong Kong flu of 1968–69 were both thought to have infected up to 500m people globally and led to 1–4m deaths. In 2009, the so-called ‘swine’ flu infected around a billion people with estimated deaths of at least 150,000, but more likely closer to 500,000.

> Several emergency planners and scientists said that the plans to protect the UK in a pandemic had once been a priority and had been well funded for the decade following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. But then austerity cuts struck. “We were the envy of the world,” the source said, “but pandemic planning became a casualty of the austerity years, when there were more pressing needs.”
  
>The last rehearsal for a pandemic was a 2016 exercise codenamed Cygnus, which predicted the health service would collapse and highlighted a long list of shortcomings — including, presciently, a lack of PPE and intensive care ventilators.
  
>An equally lengthy list of recommendations to address the deficiencies was never implemented. The source said preparations for a no-deal Brexit “sucked all the blood out of pandemic planning” in the following years.

> In the year leading up to the coronavirus outbreak key government committee meetings on pandemic planning were repeatedly “bumped” off the diary to make way for discussions about more pressing issues such as the beds crisis in the NHS. Training for NHS staff with protective equipment and respirators was also neglected, the source alleges.
  
> Members of the government advisory group on pandemics are said to have felt powerless. “They would joke between themselves, ‘Ha-ha, let’s hope we don’t get a pandemic’, because there wasn’t a single area of practice that was being nurtured in order for us to meet basic requirements for a pandemic, never mind do it well,” said the source.
