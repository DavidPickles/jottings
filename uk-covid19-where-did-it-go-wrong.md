# UK Coronavirus response: Where did it all go wrong? 

- Failure to act on what was learnt from Cygnus 
- Failure to build PPE stocks. Lots of time and opportunity wasted here. 
- Although the reasons for dropping the goal of comprehensive testing and tracing made sense - the scale would have been overwhelming - it was crazy to simply abandon   testing and tracing altogether as was done in the move from containment to delay. Instead of being abandoned it should have been focused on health and care workers, and on the vulnerable 
- Failure to protect those in care homes. Dumping infested patients back into care homes.
- There's a real chance the second wave will be worse than the first. Comms around coming out of the lockdown have been woeful. Politcal debates within cabinet and betweeen national institutions have led to confused messages
