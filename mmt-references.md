# MMT Readings

### 2013-12-09 Paul Krugman [Helicopters Don’t Help (Wonkish)](https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/helicopters-dont-help-wonkish/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&seid=auto&_r=0)

Krugman arges that QE + deficit spending is equivalent to direct monetary funding. It's supposed to be a rebuttal of a central MMT idea, but accepts many of their premises, opening the way for Fulwiler and Kelton 2013-12-11.

### 2013-12-11 Scott Fullwiler and Stephanie Kelton [Krugman, Helicopters, and Consolidation](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2013/12/krugman-helicopters-consolidation.html)

One of their conclusions is that direct monetary funding of government expenditure is a good option. 

They provide a detailed analysis important today in the light of the UK Government's recent decision to use just this kind of funding in response to the Covid-19 crisis (see 2020-04-09 Giles and Georgiadis)

They also argue that that bond issuance is pointless; direct funding is, in fact, preferable:

> because there is no difference between bond- and money-financed government deficits, there is no reason for the government to sell bonds at all.  We can stop today.  No further increases in the debt and no unnecessary and counterproductive debt ceiling drama.

The paper is a response to Krugman who argued that QE + deficit spending is equal to direct funding. But it adds that QE doesn't really bring anything to the argument:  There is a functional equivalence between direct funding and funding with bonds, QE or not. 

Krugman argued that the equivalence he identified implies that arguments about 'helicopter financing' are 'much ado about nothing'.  Fulwiler and Kelton reply that there are nonetheless advantages to directly funding government expenditure:

> Indeed, the main advantage \[of direct funding\] is not that it provides a greater boost to the monetary base but that it would relieve the government from the practice of selling bonds altogether. In other words, the main advantages of direct money creation are political rather than economic.

One issue that I have with this debate - or at least how it's labelled - is that the concept of helicopter money is a stronger one than direct monetary funding of governement expenditure. Helicopter money doesn't just imply direct money creation, it also implies that the money is distributed directly to people rather than used for government expenditure. See Coppola 2019.

An example of when one component of MMT  which many had considered wacky, suddenly became mainstream. This paper is the Bank of England saying that MMT had been right all along about where money comes from.

### 2017-04-17 David Pickles [Money is Created from Nothing (V2)](https://www.cheesearchitect.com/randoms/what-is-money/)

Tries to describe some of the foundations of MMT, at least the money creation part. 

### 2017-05-16 Tony Yates [Does it ‘cost’ anything to nationalise a company?](https://longandvariable.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/does-it-cost-anything-to-nationalise-a-company/)

Tags: *Academic*

What's interesting about this is that Yates really dislikes MMT and takes every opportunity to say so. But I don't think there's much in this that an MMTer would be unhappy with. Which just goes to show that  MMT is made up of several different components, some of which are widely shared. 

### 2019-03-01 Edward Harrison [MMT For Dummies](https://www.creditwritedowns.com/p/mmt-for-dummies) 

Tags: *Academic*

Not really for dummies. Harrison is sympathetic but not totally convinced. What I like about this is that it gives an historical and intellectual analysis. It's clear that MMT has a lot of strands, Harrison identifies them and describes their history which is interesting in itself, but it also allows you see how one can consistently accept certain parts of the MMT without buying the full monty. Which is pretty much Harrison's position. 

### 2019 Francis Coppola *The Case For People's Quantitative Easing* Polity Press

Tags: *Academic*

Coppola is primarily a banking specialist but also writes prolifically on other aspects of economics. She rarely refers in her writing to MMT except in critical terms, but so far as I can tell, she seems to share many of its fundamental beliefs. This book which makes a strong case for helicopter money is a case in point.

Tags: *Academic* *Journalistic*

A response to some articles in the FT about the New Green Deal. But although that was the immediate context,the  contents are more general. MMTers are sometimes accused of being too simplistic about taxes and inflation, this article shows that their view goes beyond 'Taxes control inflation'.

### 2020-04-06 Editorial Board of the FT [Printing money is valid response to coronavirus crisis](https://www.ft.com/content/fd1d35c4-7804-11ea-9840-1b8019d9a987)

Tags: *Covid-19* *Journalistic*

Demonstrates that many elements of MMT are now mainstream. In particular the FT editorial board seems to accept the core of Fulwiler and Kelton's 2013 analysis as correct,  and, indeed go further, suggesting that helicopter money is a viable option. I suspect they wouldn't subscribe to the idea that bond issuance is pointless though, what they are saying is that direct monetary funding is an additional funding tool in the right circumstanes.

(The artilce an mistake that had to be corrected later https://www.ft.com/content/0ebf49a4-7920-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03!)

Tags: *Academic* *Covid-19* *Journalistic*

I've included this even though it doesn't mention MMT to make clear that MMTers are not the only anti-austerity economists. There is a strong Keynesian element to MMT, and those ideas are shared well outside MMT circles.

Historic moment when BOE starts doing what MMTers have always said they should do.

This is good because it is so pragmatic. He endorses direct monetary financing and even helicopter money as a response to Covid-19, and he is realistic about the risk that these actions carry. 

By acknowledging that real helicopter money is a viable option, he goes beyond 2013-12-11 Fullwiler and Kelton's arguments. 

### 2020-04-15 Simon Wren-Lewis [Some myths about government debt and how it is financed](https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2020/04/some-myths-about-government-debt-and.html)

Tags: *Academic* *Journalistic*

Simon Wren-Lewis's response to the government creating money without creating new bonds. He steers a line between:

* "It is a problem because it causes inflation." Not right now it doesn't he says. 
* I"t is fine, we shouldn't bother with bonds at all." He says that outside of recession, funding a government with bonds rather than directly created money *is* how inflaton is controlled.  So that's why outside of a recession, governments should continue to use bonds. Just printing money outside a recession *would* create inflation.

Nathan Tankus is Research Director of the Modern Money Network, a "A student-driven initiative promoting public understanding of money, finance, law, and the economy". Focused on MMT. Tankus exemplifies a lot that is positive about MMT, including a concern to understand and explain how fianance really works. 

This paper provides clear explanations  of the main concepts of needed to understand how government monetary policy works.
