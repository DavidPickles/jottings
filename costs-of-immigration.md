First some questions of interpretation. 

It looks like you're trying to show  that a migrant entering the UK workforce affects some economically important financial total which you call 'the coffers' So I'll refer to that as the 'coffer value'.

Perhaps by coffers you mean overall government debt? And I guess that because you see you example affecting the government deficit (expenditure - income) over a short time period. Anyway that's what I'm going to assume you mean. 

I think what your saying is that a migrant entering the workforce for the first time will not reduce governement debt as much as an unemployed person finding work. 


THere are lots of issues with what you say. 

One of them, as you know, is that I don't believe that gov debt is a good measure of economic well being. See the defecit myth. I'll say something about that later, and highlight some other issues first,  because I know you don't like the claim that government debt is bad measure, and there are other issues to bring out before we get into those waters again. 

So here are a list of points. 

First point, which you might be able to accept quite easily? If this argument were valid it would work for anyone entering  the workforce who was not previously on benefits. So for example, take a young native person who's not on benefits who comes into the workforce  - they take their first job. If the coffers value would go down if a migrant enters the workforce, the coffers value would likewise go down if a native who was not previously on benefits enters the workforce.n 

Second point the argument doesn't scale. There are actually several reasons for this, so I'll number them. 

2.1 In your model a person getting work needs to be paired with

Secondly, do you think that your argument shows that as people enter the workforce the coffers value goes down? In other words are you claiming that the coffers value is inversely proportional to the number of people entering the workforce?





Perhaps by coffer value you mean the government deficit (expenditure - income) over a short time period. Is that right? 

More precisely I think what your looking for is the the difference between the net expendeture of the government going on the local person's benefit over that period of time, and the total tax income (over that period of time) from the  money that passes through the immigrant's wage packet during that period. 

For simplicity lets say we're talking about a year and the benefit, like the immigrants wage = £12K

So there's a lot going on here. 
- Things you haven't taken into account
- Controversy about whether the 'coffers value' matters very much. 

There are two things you haven't taken into account when doing your calculation. 


WL = a possible world in which Mr L, a local, does the job and so comes off benefit. Mr M, does not come to the UK.
WLM = a possible world in which M M, a migraent, does the job and  Mr L stays on benefit

Otherwise everything is exactly the same in WL and WLM (except for the effects of these differences)




First there is the immigrants purchases of food, rent, and other goods and services. All those purchases will pay money into the economy, and some of that money will go on taxes. For example suppose he pays rent to someone who buys fags, in which case some of the money will end up as taxes on those fags. Or he pays rent to a company, and that company will pay various taxes.  You can't easily predict how much over a given period of time will go on taxes  because it depends on what the person/organisation who receives it they does with it. 

[note tax will not be on the total amount spent except for purchase tax]


But anyway it's also important that the person who recieves money from the immigrant will also buy things, and the next person down the line will spend that money, and so on. And each time some momey will go on purchase tax (VAT) and some will end up as other kinds of tax. 

That cascade is important:   the people and organisations the immigrant spends money with ALSO spend money, and then the next down the line spend money, and each time some money ends up in taxes.  The whole thing is recursive. 

You also don't take into account that the local person is spending even though he's on benefit. Some of what the person is spending is going on taxes in just the same way that the money the immigrant spends goes on taxes, NOT just because some of the things they pay for have VAT or what-have-you, but also because the momey they spend circulates in the economy, and many transactions will ulimately result in some tax going to the government.  A benefit of £X paid to a recipient is NOT a net outflow of £X for the govenement because the person receiving the benefit spends it, some of the spedning goes on VAT, but pretty much all will go to businesses and those businesses pay tax of one kind or another, and whoever  the benefit recipeient pays, will themselves buy things, and so on and so on.

So I think you greatly underestimate what ends up as taxes over a given period of time and you overestimate the net cost of the benefit to the governement. 

Say there are 100 Mr Ms and their keep a couple of local businesses from closing. That means all the taxes (and subsequent taxes) are going to the govt

But yes, over a short period of time, some money won't go on taxes. 

Longer periods of time? 


So for the sake of argument I'm going to agree that over a given short period of time, if the local unemployed person  remains in exactly the same situation, the net cost to the governement to pay the local person's benefit over that period of time is greater than the total tax income (over that period of time) from the  money that passes through the immigrant's wage packet during that period. 

So we can agree on that. What we don't agree on is whether that is significant or not. I don't think it's sigificant, for several reasons. 



First, 

Secondly, over a given period of time you can't just add up the the atomic ( expenditure - income )s going to /coming from the government. People interact and very often their interactions will result in things of value being created. Why does the governement want to encourage business to expand? 









 And it looks 


You're trying to show the effect of the person on some overall funcion value - what you call ''
