This is what I think is going on. Take a core liberal belief like 'There are basic human rights'. Holland says two things about this, one of which is right and one I think is  less defensible. The first thing, which is correct, is that we - in the West - believe this bedcause of our Christian heritage, that's the route we came to this belief. What he says that is less defensible is that this belief, this statement, only has meaning within our particular christian-based culture.  So when we ask or tell those from different cultures to believe it, we are imposing our cultere on them. I don't think this - which is a kind of relativism - is right, but it's not trivially wrong, and it's an impoprtant and influential belief despite its being mistaken. 

What is impressive about Holland is the level of historical detail he provides about  how we came to these kinds of liberal beliefs. And I find it interesting, though unfortunate, that although for some people culteral relativism is hyper-liberalism, for Holland it seems to be moving him to a kind of conservativism. 

In Holland's defense though I think his is a more consistent and coherent move for a relativist to make than to become a hyper-liberal. That is one reason that the hyper-liberal form of relativism scares me, I don't think it's a stable place to be, and it leads to a something uglier, at the quite the opposite end of the political spectrum.
