covered a lot of ground
- history of the and nazis and the war in europe to some extent
  - didn't know hitler had a sister called 'Paula hitler'
- of the holocaust
- of that region of galicia
- biogs of 
  - Hersch Lauterpacht
  - Rafael Lemkin
  - Leon Buchholz
- his own journey of discovry
- history of international jurisprudence
- nuremburg trials
- legal analyis of 'crimes againat hum' and 'genocide'


really interesting on cah and gen
- feel strongly against idea of gen
- let's sov un of the hook
- doesnt entirely make sense

implicit questions about the role of the individual
- Hans Frank, kind of feel some other nazi would have stepped up
- Lauterpach and Lemkin, sometimes gave the impression they were solely responsible for the idea of international human rights and a legal framework. Perhaps influenctial
- Hitler?

perhaps  bit too much ground
- some parts more successful than other
  - lauterpacht good
  - lemkin a bit sketchy, coud have been more generous. He was an outsider
  - His gandfather, so many details in the book perhaps rather covers up that he didn't get that far
    - maybe why he chose to expand the subject matter so widely?
- Could have done with a family tree
- and perhaps some war timelines
