Slits: 1 and 2 (or 1 is up and 2 is down)
- At t1 no-one observes movement of photon
- At t2 A observes photon going through slit 1
- At t3 B observes A observing

Same structure might work for Shrodinger's cat. 
- At t2 the cat (A) observers the quantum even by either dying or living
- At t3 B observe the cat, and sees whether it's alive or dead.

Where's the guarantee that when B peeks his view of what A observes matches her view of what she observes? That there is consistency in their views? Because if there's no consistency we end up with the many worlds interpretation or similar.

I think the problem is harder to solve in the slit case than in the cat case, so I'll focus on the slit case.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_quantum_mechanics (I've changed O to A, and O' to B, and the status to 1 and 2 rather than up and down)

> But, let us imagine that B measures the spin of S, and finds it to have spin 2 (and note that nothing in the analysis above precludes this from happening). What happens if he talks to A, and they compare the results of their experiments? A, it will be remembered, measured a spin 1 on the particle. This would appear to be paradoxical: the two observers, surely, will realise that they have disparate results.

An 'M operator' is introduced, I think pretty much all this means is that we don't start trying to formalise situations where someone makes a mistake in their observation...

> However, this apparent paradox only arises as a result of the question being framed incorrectly: as long as we presuppose an "absolute" or "true" state of the world, this would, indeed, present an insurmountable obstacle for the relational interpretation. However, in a fully relational context, there is no way in which the problem can even be coherently expressed. The consistency inherent in the quantum formalism, exemplified by the "M-operator" defined above, guarantees that there will be no contradictions between records. The interaction between B and whatever he chooses to measure, be it the S+A compound system or A and S individually, will be a physical interaction, a quantum interaction, and so a complete description of it can only be given by a further observer C, who will have a similar "M-operator" guaranteeing coherency, and so on out. In other words, a situation such as that described above cannot violate any physical observation, as long as the physical content of quantum mechanics is taken to refer only to relations.

The problem is that:

- 05 says A believes that S[1]
- 06 says B believes both that S[2] and that A believes that S[2]

05 and 06 are consistent, they don't contradict one another, but they do seem to imply that A and B have beliefs that are inconsistent with one another.And how can you stop them talking?

A and B are describing the world in inconsistent ways. And after t3, when A and B start communicating, the inconsistency will show up.  So, to stress again, it's not that 05 and 06 are inconsistent, it's just that they are unstable. As soon as A and B compare notes, one of them would have to change their description in order to align. This looks like a weird and implausible empirical prediction - that half the time it turns out that there is a conflict between a report from an observer and a report from an observer observer.

The trick, somehow, must be to avoid seeing 05 and 06 as making factual claims about the A and B's belief states. The point of RQM is precisely to avoid such moves; if RQM is correct, there is no neutral fact to the matter about what people believe any more than there is neutral fact to the matter about states of non-observers.   But it's a hard trick to pull off.

Our issue, remember, is that after t3, as soon as A and B talk, the difference between them will become apparent to both. Communication is just an aspect of interaction, and that interaction begins at t3. The problem is not that 05 and 06 are inconsistent, it's that they are unstable because there seems nothing to prevent A and B comparing records.

According to RQM  any description in which A and B talk will be a description from some third party's point of view.  According to RQM there is no God's eye view of A and B from which 05 and 06 cause trouble. That's why the observer observer observer, C, is introduced. C provides a point of view on B who is observing A. Without any interaction between A, B and C, 07 describes the uncollapsed wave function which is all that C can say about the situation.  If C does interact, the function will collapse to one of its disjuncts, and each disjunt is self-consistent.

What is both interesting and difficult about this is that it does NOT privilege individual experience. There are no more neutral facts about experience and belief than there are neutral facts  states of matter.
