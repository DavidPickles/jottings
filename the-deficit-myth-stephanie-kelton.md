# Kelton the Deficit Myth

## 6 Myths

pp 10-11

1. The federal government should budget like a household.
  - Kelton's point is that governements are source of currency not users
  - She doesn't I think make the varifoukas (Keynes) point that gov's income depends on the amount of production in the economy, and it lowers the amount of production by spedning less - ie its income goes down if it spends less. Unlike a household.
2. Deficits are evidence of overspending.
  - "The government's budget is not supposed to balance. Our economy is. p 43"
  - evidence of overspending is inflation
  - inflation means the money supply outstrips the economy's productive capacity
  - high inflation is bad
  - a deficit per se is good it means that the private sector is benefiting
3. Deficits will burden the next generation. 
4. Deficits are harmful because they crowd out private investment and undermine long-term growth.
5. Deficits make the United States dependent on foreigners.
6. Entitlements are propelling us to a long term fiscal crisis.

## 4 Reasons for taxation

pp 33-34

Taxes enable governments ...
1. to provision themselves without the use of explicit force,
  - provision means the existence of taxes motivates people to work, as a matter of individual motivation so they can buy stuff, but from the govs interest so that the governement can get some of the stuff that is produced. 
  - "taxes were the vehicles that allowed ancient rulers and early nation-states to introduce their own currencies, which only later circulated as a medium of exchange among private individuals. From inception, the tax liability creates people looking for paid work (aka unemployment) in the government's currency. The government (or other authority) then spends its currency into existence giving people access to the tokens they need to settle their obligations to the state. Obviously, no one can pay the tax until the government first supplies its tokens." p 27
  - Moser story with his children
  - See pp 26-27 and 30-31. 
  - This is the one I find a bit difficult. 
    - Income tax means that people are not as individuals motivated to work by the demands of government for tax on them. Quite the reverse. 
    - But there might be some origin story (Chartalism p 27) that says gov currency gets established as a unit of account and medium of exchange because the gov demands tax in the currency. 
    - And a similar story operates to explain why gov currency continues to be the unit of account and medium of exchange, the pizza parlor demands currency for pizzas because it has to pay taxes in currency. 
    - And because suppliers need currency to pay tax, consumers need currency to buy goods and services. 
2. to control inflation,
3. to alter the distribution of wealth and income,
4. to influence behaviours. 


## S(TAB) vs (BAT)S

## US Treasuries are just interest bearing dollars p 36


## Anti-NAIRU

Non-accelerating inflationary rate of unemployment
- the point at which any further decline in unemployment causes inflation to increase
- fed raies interest rate if things too hot, lowers if too cold
- but NAIRU can only be infered "from the response of wage compensation and price inflation as the labour market tightens" p 51

Two separte points: estimates of NAIRU are wrong, the concept of NAIRU is misguided
- thugh it's not entirely beside the point, if one is arguing the latter, that estimates of NAIRU have been so consistently wrong recently; perhaps there is a NAIRU, but it's unknowable is hardly a defence of the conventional approach. 

From Lerner to MMT
- Functional finance. Allow the private sector to come as close as pos to achieving full employment on its own, and then rely on fiscal policy to make up any shortfall
- A balanced budget is one where there is full employment and price stability, the deficit is irrelevant - it's just a sign that a tool is being used a certain way. 
- MMT goes further and recommends a job guarantee. 
- One powerful argument in favour is just how much needs to be done. Care, climate, infrastructure, ... The current arrangments have failed. 
- Another is that the job guarantee would act as a powerful automatic stabiliser 
- Right now there is a huge amount of 'fiscal space' difference between actual productivity and capability

## National Debt

The ur-confusion: debt is bad, treasuries are good p 77

foreigners need dollars and get dollars through sales to each other and to the US

US offers them an interest bearing alternative to dollars - treasury bonds

Green (currency) vs Yellow (bonds)
- MMT sees very close relation. They are both government liabilities, only difference is Yellow incur more liability
- Creation of Yellow rather than Green is a matter of convention, tradition rather than a necessity. Could create Green instead of Yellow, and then the national debt would (eventually)just go away.
- A gov buying its own debt from the market is just a way to convert Yellow to Green (how to think of QE)
- A gov selling bonds is converting Green to Yellow, but the overall size of liabilities doesn't change (though they do increase over time cos of ir)
- p 87 - the useful function of bond sales by gov is to control interest rates 
  - p 117 "From an MMT perspective, the purpose of selling bonds is not to "finance" government expenditures (which have already taken place) but to prevent a large infusion of reserves from pushing the overnight interest rate below the Fed's target level"
- p 91 "a gov that borrows in in its own sovereign currency can always maintain the critical conidition for sustainability (r < g). It never has to accept a market rate of interet."  
  - Not totally sure of that last point. I guess if no-one buys, they can just print more currency instead?
- p 86 ff a lot of stuff about there being no chance of default from currency creating nation. Is default the only risk that affects price though? What about collapse of relative value? Would be equivalent to a default. You'd get your dollars back but they wouldn't be worth anything

Governent surpluses shift debt debt onto the non-gov sector
- non gov is borrowing from the gov instead of the other way around

IR Control
- Old way
  - IR up: gov sells bonds, G2Y -> reserves(G) go down -> harder to get, so banks increase ir to each other
  - IR down: gov buys bonds, Y2G -> resrves(G) go up -> easy to get so banck reduce ir to each other
- New way: change IR on reserves

the non gov sector needs to have some kind of interest bearng gov liability in order for the gov to have any control over interest rates


## Crowding out

if gov is doing a lot of borrowing, there isn't funding avaliable for other project

But. Wynne Godley Gov fin balance + Non gov fin balance = 0
- Fiscal deficits don't eat the non gov sector's saving, they enlarge them
- And the dollars used to buy bonds are created by the gov, there is no a fixed supply

Short term: deficits drive ir down because there're more reserves sloshing around. That's why gov bought its own short term bonds to bring ir up. 

p 119 ff a lot of detail on how bond markets work. empirical! (important to understand this is based on detailed empirical work)

p 124 the competition betweeen bonds and the asset at which an exchange is fixed " explains the very high interest rates paid by governements with perceived default risk in fixed exchange regimes, in contrast to the ease a nation such as Japan has in keeping rates at 0 in a floating exchange rate regime" But again even with a floating x rate, what abou the collapse in relative value of the currency?

## Trade

Trade is not a zero sum game, that's the fundamental thing

is US 'losing' or 'winning' because it's getting stuff it wants (goods) in exchange for stuff that foreigners want (dollars)?


## Issues

She doesn't talk about the fundemantal nature of money: that it's a funny sort of liability that ony a government can take on, based on a promise to make a promise. 

No mention of the role of private bank money. Private banks can create money as governements can. The difference is that a banks IOU may have to be redeemed with someone else's IOU. So  a bank's money exposes the bank in a way that governement's money doesn't expose the governement. Fundamentally that's how the money supply is controlled. Banks can make as many IOUs as they like, but they always want to balance an IOU with an asset - an IOU from somoeone else. A governement doesn't need that balancing asset. 

(And the bank needs to be sure that the assets they acquire are safe (the debtors won't default), and will genrate enough income via interest to cover thir liabilities)


Bucket analogy works to an extent but doesn't make clear WHY everything has to balance. It's because we're really talking about IOUs, and flows of dollars are a picturesque way of talking about IOUs being adjusted either in favour of the party with the liability (the govt) or in favour of the one with the asset (the non-govt-sector).
